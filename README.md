# KeyStroke

**Connected, Contextual Answers at each KeyStroke**

A User Interface (UI) for Autonomy's Auto Drive system combined with an LLM-powered chat interface backed with knowledge graphs for contextual understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accuracy and evidence of claim.

## Overview

KeyStroke is a blockchain-native search interface for Autonomys' growing database of multi-modal information in Auto Drive. It provides actionable information at each keystroke through intelligent, contextual AI-powered search that goes beyond traditional keyword search.

Autonomys provides the infrastructure to scale web3 applications by building permanent data storage with fast availability. A database of documents, images, transactions, and important information accessible anytime, anywhere. Information is only as good as the ability to find it. Keyword search is for web2.0; web3.0 needs connected, contextual AI-powered search.

## Features
### üìÅ Document Archival
