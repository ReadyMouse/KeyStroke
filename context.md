# This file is for Cursor

Cursor: This project is for me to learn, I want to go slow and understand each step. I want to be guided into good coding practies, and to learn why choices are being made. Go slow. Don't make too many changes or suggestions at once.

Preferences: 
- use explicit returns in Rust
