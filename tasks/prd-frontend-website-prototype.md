# Product Requirements Document: Frontend Website Prototype

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a frontend website prototype that will host document upload/retrieval functionality and chat features. The website will serve as a platform for document management and knowledge base creation with AI chat assistance. The prototype will focus on creating a modern, minimalist interface that provides a foundation for future development of advanced document processing and AI interaction capabilities.

## Goals

1. Create a functional prototype with all main UI components (login, settings, banners, document upload, chat interface)
2. Implement a dashboard-style layout with cards/widgets for easy navigation
3. Provide a clean, modern, and minimalist user interface
4. Establish a foundation for document upload and retrieval functionality
5. Include placeholder chat functionality for future AI integration
6. Ensure the interface is intuitive and accessible to public users

## User Stories

1. **As a public user**, I want to access the website and see a clean, professional interface so that I can understand the platform's purpose immediately.

2. **As a user**, I want to see a login button in the interface so that I understand the platform will have authentication features.

3. **As a user**, I want to upload various document formats (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text) so that I can build my knowledge base.

4. **As a user**, I want to view my uploaded documents in an organized dashboard layout so that I can easily find and manage my content.

5. **As a user**, I want to access a chat interface so that I can interact with my documents (placeholder for future AI features).

6. **As a user**, I want to access settings to see what configuration options will be available so that I understand the platform's capabilities.

7. **As a user**, I want to see clear navigation and branding in the top and bottom banners so that I can easily navigate the site and understand the brand.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Interface Elements
- The system must provide a simple login button for visual purposes (no actual authentication)
- The system must display a placeholder user status in the top banner
- The system must include a logout option in the settings page (visual only)

### 2. Dashboard Layout
- The system must display a dashboard-style interface with cards/widgets
- The system must include a main content area for document management
- The system must provide clear navigation between different sections

### 3. Document Upload Functionality
- The system must allow users to upload PDF files
- The system must allow users to upload Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- The system must allow users to upload Excel files (.xls, .xlsx)
- The system must allow users to upload PowerPoint files (.ppt, .pptx)
- The system must allow users to upload text files (.txt)
- The system must display uploaded documents in an organized grid or list view
- The system must show upload progress and confirmation messages

### 4. Chat Interface
- The system must provide an empty chat box interface
- The system must display the chat interface in a dedicated area
- The system must include a text input field for future message functionality
- The system must show a placeholder for chat history

### 5. Settings Page
- The system must provide a generic settings page accessible from the main navigation
- The system must include placeholder user profile settings (name, email) for visual purposes
- The system must include a logout button (visual only, no actual functionality)
- The system must provide a clean, organized settings interface

### 6. Top Banner
- The system must display the website logo/branding
- The system must include main navigation links
- The system must show user controls (login status, profile access)
- The system must maintain consistent branding and navigation

### 7. Bottom Banner
- The system must display contact information
- The system must include legal links (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy)
- The system must maintain consistent styling with the top banner

### 8. Responsive Design
- The system must be responsive and work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- The system must maintain the dashboard layout across different screen sizes
- The system must ensure all interactive elements are accessible

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Advanced AI Features**: The chat functionality will be a placeholder only - no actual AI processing or document analysis
2. **User Registration**: No actual authentication or user registration functionality
3. **Document Processing**: No actual document parsing, indexing, or search functionality
4. **Database Integration**: No persistent storage of documents or user data
5. **Advanced Settings**: Only basic settings page, no complex configuration options
6. **Real-time Features**: No real-time updates, notifications, or collaborative features
7. **Advanced Security**: No actual authentication or security features
8. **Analytics**: No user behavior tracking or analytics implementation

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Style**: Modern and minimalist design similar to Notion
- **Color Scheme**: Clean, neutral colors with subtle accents
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Generous white space for clean, uncluttered appearance

### Layout Structure
- **Dashboard Layout**: Card-based interface with widgets for different sections
- **Navigation**: Clear, intuitive navigation between sections
- **Banners**: Consistent top and bottom banners with branding and links
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that scales to larger screens

### UI Components
- **Cards**: Clean card components for document display and navigation
- **Buttons**: Modern, accessible button styles
- **Forms**: Clean form inputs for login and settings
- **Upload Area**: Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload interface
- **Chat Box**: Simple text area with placeholder styling

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Framework
- Use Jekyll static site generator with Bundler for dependency management
- Implement vanilla JavaScript for interactive components
- Use modern CSS with Grid/Flexbox for responsive design
- Consider using Jekyll plugins for enhanced functionality

### File Handling
- Implement client-side file validation for supported formats
- Use appropriate file input types and accept attributes
- Consider file size limits and user feedback

### State Management
- No actual state management required for visual prototype
- Use placeholder data for demonstration purposes
- Focus on visual design and layout only

### Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Test on different screen sizes and devices

## Success Metrics

For this prototype phase, success will be measured by:
1. **Functional Completeness**: All specified components are implemented and working
2. **User Experience**: Interface is intuitive and easy to navigate
3. **Visual Design**: Clean, modern appearance matching the minimalist aesthetic
4. **Responsive Design**: Works properly across different device sizes
5. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, maintainable code suitable for future development

## Open Questions

1. **Branding**: What is the website name and logo to be used in the banners?
2. **Color Scheme**: Are there specific brand colors to incorporate?
3. **Content**: What placeholder content should be used for the chat interface?
4. **Document Limits**: Should there be file size limits for document uploads?
5. **Future Integration**: What backend technologies should be considered for future development?
6. **Deployment**: Where will this prototype be hosted for testing and demonstration?

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on creating a solid foundation that can be easily extended
- Prioritize clean, semantic HTML and accessible design
- Use modern CSS techniques for responsive design
- Implement proper error handling for file uploads
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper focus states
- Consider using a design system for consistent component styling
