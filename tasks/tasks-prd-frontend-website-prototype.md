- This is a pure HTML/CSS implementation with no JavaScript dependencies.
- All interactions are handled through CSS-only solutions (checkbox toggles, :target selectors).
- Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the development server.
- Use `bundle exec jekyll build` to build the static site.
- The site works perfectly without JavaScript enabled.
